        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Bacon fries are just something out of this world. 
            If French fries weren't already perfect by themselves, now make them even more awesome by wrapping bacon around them. 
            Garnish with parsley flakes and eat while warm, with a sriracha ketchup sauce if you like.
