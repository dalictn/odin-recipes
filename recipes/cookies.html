        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> I love cookie butter! I was able to find a way to make cookie butter cookies. 
            I could not find any recipe that used cookie butter, so I am glad I can share this recipe with the world. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup cookie butter</li>
            <li>½ cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                reheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. 
                Add cookie butter and peanut butter; beat until fluffy. 
                Mix flour, egg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the butter mixture creating a cookie dough. 
                Roll dough into teaspoon-size balls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread 1/3 cup sugar into a shallow dish. 
                Roll dough balls in the sugar to coat and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet. 
                Press dough balls with a fork twice to flatten slightly and press a crosshatch shape into the top of the cookies./li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.
